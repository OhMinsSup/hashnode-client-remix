/**
 * `SkipRenderOnClient` is a SSR performance hack that allows you to
 * conditionally render components on the client-side, bypassing hydration,
 * without introducing hydration mismatches.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <SkipRenderOnClient shouldRenderOnClient={() => window.innerWidth <= 500}>
 *   <MyComponent />
 * </SkipRenderOnClient>
 * ```
 *
 * Context:
 *
 * When using React's server-side rendering, we often need to render components
 * on the server even if they are conditional on the client e.g. hidden based on
 * window width.
 *
 * However, in order for hydration to succeed, the first client render must
 * match the DOM generated from the HTML returned by the server. This means the
 * component must be rendered again during the first client render.
 *
 * Hydration is expensive, so we really don't want to pay that penalty only for
 * the element to be hidden or removed immediately afterwards.
 *
 * `SkipRenderOnClient` conditionally skips hydrating children by removing them
 * from the DOM _before the first client render_. Removing them before ensures
 * hydration is successful.
